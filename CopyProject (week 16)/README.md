The goal of this project is to display in a graph the time to copy files with different sizes.

A script allows to create files with differents sizes, these files are copyied and then deleted.
The number of files size can be determined in the variable end, it begins to 1Mb to the end.
Then, it's better to have an average of the time, so, we can determined the number of times these files will be created, copied and deleted.
All times are put in a file called time. A python script allows to get his times and displays the average of these times in a graph.
