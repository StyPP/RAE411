The bash script allows to generate a file "result.txt" which response time of the ping command.
Then, the python script gets these times and create table. 
To finish, the average, the standard deviation and the variance are computed.
The histogram and boxplot are also generated.

Like this work was done with dataframe, png files are only screenshot because dataframe doesn't allows to generate png or pdf.
