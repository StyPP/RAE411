# Expm

The goal of this project is to learn 3 languages with the computation of the expm fucntion with a matrix given.

I have code again the function expm in Python, this was interesting to think about it with different fucntion definitions. I have also code this project in three different languages, Python, R and Octave. In the three langauges, the code can accpet all squares matrix to computes the expm fucntion and return some graph in PDF and in JPG/PNG.

I have spend time on this micro project and I am enjoying to have finish it. Once time, I had the code, I tried to repeat the same code, with same variables, name, same commentaries. 
The difficult is that the language are different.
For example the 'for' has a very different syntax in the three languages with the begin, the end and the range. I have also seen that there is a mistake in Python about the 'for'. AWS predict some name and parameters about functions, 
and in the case of 'for', the step and the end are reverse. 

It was a good project to discover other languages.
