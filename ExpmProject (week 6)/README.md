# My uProject

I have spend time on this micro project and I am enjoying to have finish it.
Once time, I had he code, I tried to repeat the same code, with same variables
name, same commentaries. 
The difficult is that the language are different.
For example the 'for' has a very different syntax in the three languages with 
the begin, the end and the range. I have also seen that there is a mistake in
Python about the 'for'. AWS predict some name and parameters about functions, 
and in the case of 'for', the step and the end are reverse. 

It was a good project to discover other languages.
