I have coded again the expm function and then display for a range precise at the begining of the python file.
The output is on the graph.pdf and on the graph.png.

When we have learn to code in R and Octave, I have done the same code in R and Octave.

I have also globalized the code for all square matrix in Python, R and Octave.
